## Description

This project is a back end for an e-commerce website that allows users to get,put,post, and delete products tags and categories of products.


## Usage
The user will open a terminal from the schema.sql file then enter psql -U postgress and their password for postgres.
Then enter \i schema.sql to create the database.

Then in another intergrated terminal the user will run node seeds/index.js to seed the database.
The next command in the terminal will be npm start and you will see the App listening on port 3001!

You can then go to Insomnia and test the different get,put,delete, and post routes.
